                <li>Call a state or district office first.</li>
                <li>Leave a voicemail. If voicemail is full, press "0". This will typically connect you to a receptionist who may be able to take your message or transfer you to a voicemail that isn't full.</li>
                <li>Call the national office if you can't get through at the district level or if you want to try to reach a real person elsewhere.</li>
                <li>Be prepared to give your name and your location. You can refer to yourself as a constituent, as per the script, and they might not ask.</li>
                <li>Note that the operator is likely using some kind of form to mark your call. The goal is to generate a high volume of calls that require the operator to check off individual boxes. That means itâ€™s critical to name your issues specifically and not just say something like "oppose Trump."</li>
